# EasyBank Landing Page

Welcome to the EasyBank Landing Page project! This is a front-end development project aimed at creating a sleek and modern landing page for a fictional bank called EasyBank. The design was inspired by a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), and the goal is to practice and showcase front-end development skills.


## Overview

This project is a static landing page for EasyBank, a fictional online banking service. The page is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with sections highlighting the bank's features, articles, and a call-to-action for users to sign up.

The project is currently not responsive, but responsiveness will be added in the near future to ensure the page looks great on all devices.



## Features

- **Hero Section**: A visually appealing introduction to EasyBank with a call-to-action button.
- **Features Section**: Highlights the key features of EasyBank, such as online banking, budgeting, and onboarding.
- **Articles Section**: Displays recent articles or blog posts related to finance and banking.
- **Footer**: Contains links to important pages, social media icons, and a call-to-action for signing up.



## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the landing page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page and creating a modern look.
- **JavaScript**: For any interactive elements (if applicable).
